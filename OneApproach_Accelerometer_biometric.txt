1. Feature Space
	{ T, X, Y, Z, Device }

2. Trasformation
	Sequence => Record
		X					Y
	{VarX, VarY, VarZ} => {Device}

3. Train => 
	Define range <i, j> for each device and randomly sample 100 continuous samples from this range
	1 Sequence => 1 Record
	Variance -> 
	1037*10

4. Test =>
	Random 100 <i, j>
	repeat
	classify -> y
